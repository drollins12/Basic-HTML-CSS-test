                I grew up in three different areas in my life. 
                The first one is the one place I grew up the most and I call my home city.
                Chicago is probably the best city to live in, some of the best places to come and see during summer. 
                Next place is Houston Texas, I didn't spend much time living there only a year. I can barely remember what I did to tell a story.
                Last is Indiana, I've been spending the last 4 years in this state for college. The last 4 years have been some of my best ones yet.

                I enjoy playing video games the most in my spare time. 
                God of War, Call of Duty, and Madden are probably my favorites games I play.
                I also enjoy working on my computer coding skills by going to Codecademy to hone my skills on web developement.
